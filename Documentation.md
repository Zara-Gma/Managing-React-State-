## Rules of Hooks

- Only are for function components
  > Can be consumed in classes too
- Start with "use"
- Only call them at the top level
  > Consistent order
  > Can't be called inside functions, conditionals, or loops
- Note: React tracks the order that hooks are run so it can store their corresponding data
- Need to run a hook conditionally?
  > Place condition inside the hook
